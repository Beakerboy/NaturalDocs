 <div class="CBody"><p>Natural Docs will read POD comments in &quot;=begin nd&quot; sections and treat them the same as any other documentation comments.&nbsp; You can also substitute &quot;naturaldocs&quot; or &quot;natural docs&quot; for &quot;nd&quot; and it's not case-sensitive.&nbsp; Like regular comments they must also include topic lines, or if Perl has full language support appear directly above a code element.</p><p>Natural Docs will also read POD comment sections which uses just the shorthand &quot;=nd&quot; or any of the substitutions, though this is not valid POD.&nbsp; It's valid Perl so the scripts will execute just fine, but using this method may cause POD parsers to become confused and include some of the unformatted text in their output.</p><p>Natural Docs also supports &quot;=pod begin nd&quot; and its substitutions, though this generally isn't mentioned in the documentation.&nbsp; This is because that syntax was a mistake made early on and so it's only included for backwards compatibility.&nbsp; Its use should not be encouraged.</p><p>Natural Docs will also read POD comments in &quot;=begin jd&quot; or &quot;=begin javadoc&quot; sections and treate them the same as Javadoc comments.&nbsp; It also supports the &quot;=jd&quot; and &quot;=javadoc&quot; shorthand.</p><p>All other POD sections are ignored.&nbsp; Recognized sections do not have to appear alone, so a POD comment can start with &quot;=pod&quot;, go to &quot;=begin nd&quot;, and then go back to &quot;=pod&quot; without a &quot;=cut&quot; in between.&nbsp; Multiple consecutive recognized sections are treated as separate comments.</p></div>
